Most Fuel Efficient car
Given fuel consumed and the distance covered for a certain number of cars, find the most fuel efficient car.
Input Format:
First line will contain the number N representing the number of cars.
Next N lines will contain the fuel consumed in liters and the distance run in kilometers (both separated by a space).
Output Format:
The number of the car which is most fuel efficient.
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
3
10 300
20 550
15 460
Output:
3
Explanation:
Average mileage of car 1 = 300/10 = 30 km/liter, car 2 = 550/20 = 27.5 km/liter, car 3 = 460/15 = 30.67 km/liter Hence car 3 is most fuel efficient and hence 3 is printed.
Example 2:
Input:
5
10 200
20 400
10 210
20 430
15 250
Output:
4
Explanation:
Car 4 having 430/20 = 21.5 km/liter is the most efficient.
